# K-means
In this repository, we will discuss the work of K-means algorithm using Python's Sklearn (scikit-learn). K-means is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to cluster or partition similar the data objects (data records) of your dataset into groups or clusters. Between the wide range of clustering techniques, the k-means is one of the oldest and most used in applications and domains.

The conventional k-means algorithm follows a set of sequential steps to partition the input data into k disjoint clusters:

- Step1: Define K (known as centroids), which are initially random points as cluster centers and the value of k reflects the number of clusters.
- Step2: For each data point in the dataset:
- Step2.1: Calculate the distance between such data point and each of the K centroids
- Step2.2: Assign the data point to the cluster of the shortest calculated distance
- Step2.3: Calculate the new cluster's center (the centroid) by computing the average of the data points within such cluster
